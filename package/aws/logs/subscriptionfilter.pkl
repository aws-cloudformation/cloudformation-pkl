/// The ``AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter`` resource specifies a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are:
///
///   +  An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
///   +  A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.
///   +  An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
///   +  An LAMlong function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
///   
///  There can be as many as two subscription filters associated with a log group.
