/// Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS-account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the ``PutBucketPolicy`` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.
///
///  If you don't have ``PutBucketPolicy`` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a ``403 Access Denied`` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error.
///    As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS-account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action. 
///   For more information, see [Bucket policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html).
///  The following operations are related to ``PutBucketPolicy``:
///   +   [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html) 
///   +   [DeleteBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html)
